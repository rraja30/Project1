#### Q2: How do environmental variables (visibility, precipitation, and temperature) affect the number of traffic accidents before and during the Covid-19 Pandemic?
#### Q2 Hypothesis: 
Null Hypothesis(H0): There is no evidence of a coorelation between environmental factors and traffic accidents, even when analyzed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): Based on data separated by the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the existence of environmental factors such as low visibility, high levels of precipitation, and temperature variation, result in an increase in the number of traffic accidents over the course of the pandemic. 
#### Q2 FINDINGS:

Our dataset contains information from January 2018 through December of 2021 with a total of 2,556,561 reported traffic incidents. For question 2, after cleaning and separating the data we examined 224,843 traffic accidents prior to the start of the pandemic and 2,010,423 traffic accidents that occured during the pandemic. In separating the data and then analyzing environmental factors, we hoped to see some difference in the number of traffic accidents to then make comparisions regarding environmental factors; however, we found that there was not a significant increase in traffic accidents as a result of the pandemic. 

Conclusions: 

Effects of Visibility: We graphed visibility at the time of the accident on a scatter plot, which resulted in a heavily left skewed scatter plot which suggests that visibility did not have an effect on traffic accidents. Most of the data indicated that traffic accidents took place while visibility was over 10 miles. Thus we are able to draw the conclusion that visibility at the time of the accident has little individual impact on the occurence of traffic accidents. 
 
Effects of Temperature: We created a bar graph that showcases the number of traffic incidents with the 25 most common temperatures in the dataset. We found that during the pandemic as well as prior to it, as temperature increased, the number of traffic accidents did as well. We can attribute this to the fact that because of nicer weather conditions, a higher population will be driving, thus resulting in more chances for accidents to occur. 

Effects of Precipitation: We graphed precipitation in inches at the time of the accident on a scatter plot, which resulted in a heavily left skewed scatter plot in that most accidents occured when there was 0 precipitation. This suggests that precipitation as an individual variable does not have significant impact on traffic accidents occuring or not. We can attribute this to the fact that with the occurence of precipitation drivers are actually more cautious while driving, thus lowering the number of accidents while there is precipitation. 

General Weather Condition: 

#### Q4: 
Did time of day increase the likelihood of accidents before or during Covid-19? Was day time or night time driving affected by Covid, based on number of accidents?

#### Q4 - Hypothesis: 
Null Hypothesis (H0): Neither daytime nor night time driving was significantly impacted by Covid-19. 

Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The number of traffic accidents during Covid pandemic is lower, both during the day and at night, than pre-pandemic because people would be less likely to travel due to Covid-19 restrictions.

#### Q4 FINDINGS:

 Totals: 
  From January 2018 through December of 2021 this dataset looked at a total of 2,556,561 reported traffic incidents.
  Of the total, 1,602,212 (or about 63%) of these accidents occured during the day time.
  954,349 (or about 37%) occured at night.
 
 PRE-COVID - 
  In the years 2018 and 2019 (Pre-Covid), daytime and night time accidents combined were 421,781 (a little over 16% of total accidents   from 2018 through 2021).
  Of the 420+ thousand incidents, 290,563 (or 69%) occured during the day.
  131,218 (or 31%) occured at night.
 
 DURING COVID - 
  In the years 2019 and 2020 (During Covid), daytime and night time accidents combined were 2,134,780 (about 84% of total                 accidents from 2018 through 2021).
  Of the 2 million + incidents, 1,311,649 (or 61%) occured during the day.
  823,131 (or about 39%) occured at night.
  
  CONCLUSIONS: 
    Total combined accidents increased by 1,712,999 or about 405% during Covid. It is obvious that the Covid lockdown caused more           drivers to be on the road, that perhaps would have otherwise been at work with vehicles parked. Digging deeper into trends of           daytime vs. night time incidents, we found that daytime incidents increased by about 351% during Covid, whereas nigth time             incidents increased by about 527%. So, even though there were far more incidents during the day both pre and during Covid, there       was a significantly higher rate increase in night time incidents during Covid.
